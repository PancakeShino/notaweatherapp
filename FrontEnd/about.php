        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p> &emsp;Welcome to Encorehub! This is our capstone project for IT490, Systems Integration, at NJIT. 
            It is a demonstration of the Setlist.fm API and RabbitMQ, designed to enhance the way fans engage with live music. 
            We have also integrated the TicketMaster and Spotify APIs to give more detailed information about past and upcoming shows for users, 
            while detailed maps enable users to see the date and exact location of the venue.
            With Encorehub, users can register for our service to unlock a suite of features that make discovering and tracking live performances 
            easier than ever.
            </p>
        <p>
            &emsp;Encorehub allows users to search for various artists, explore detailed show histories, and stay updated on current tours.
             For registered accounts, Encorehub takes it a step further, enabling them to follow their favorite artists and receive personalized
             updates and notifications as upcoming shows draw near. Whether you're a casual fan or a concert enthusiast, our platform is tailored 
             to make your concert experience more connected and convenient.
